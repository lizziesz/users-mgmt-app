# UsersMgmtApp

This is a simple CRUD app that can create new users (with a username, first name, last name, and email), update users, and delete users against a locally running API. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Miscellaneous Thoughts

I chose Angular for this project as I am currently working most heavily with that framework, so it was quick for me to get up and running. I decided to use Observable data services and RxJs to handle state management. I chose to include Angular Material as a CSS framework as it provides strong Angular support.

## What Would I Improve?

With more time, I would first focus on:

* Responsiveness with styling. I have not accounted for responsiveness yet, so this app is only optimized for a desktop layout. With a couple responsive breakpoints, it could be quickly made responsive for mobile layouts.

* Add tests. The only tests are the default tests generated by the Angular CLI, and I have not yet made them pass. I would make sure these default tests pass, and add basic tests to cover essential workflows of the app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
